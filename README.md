> A reusable configuration for ESLint

This package supplies a ESLint configuration to the entire monorepo.
By reusing the same configuration across all projects, it ensures that best practices are followed and that the code is consistent.

For more information on ESLint, see the [docs](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/).
